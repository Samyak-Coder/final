          <!--<a href="#header">History of Apple</a>-->
          <p style="text-align :center">
            Apple Computers, Inc. was founded on April 1, 1976, by college dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who brought to the new company a vision of changing the way people viewed computers.The company's first product is the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak. To finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Microbus, for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for US$500 (equivalent to $2,274 in 2020). Wozniak debuted the first prototype at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976. The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer. It went on sale soon after debut for US$666.66 (equivalent to $3,032 in 2020). Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".<br>The next generation and successor was Apple II. The Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire. It differs from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. While early Apple II models use ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978. The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "killer application" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979. VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office. Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place competitor to Commodore and Tandy.<br>Let’s move a bit faster…
            The next hit by Apple was the Macintosh. The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface, built-in screen, and mouse. Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until the latter was discontinued in 1993.
            The Macintosh couldn’t attract more customers, and only some units were sold, board of directors thought that they should change their marketing schemes, so they fired Steve Jobs and made Ronald to be the CEO. Ronald unfortunately couldn’t do any better to Apple. In the time Steve Jobs started another company called NeXT Computers which basically focuses on a GUI based Operating System for Education Market, they also developed the NeXTos which was then transformed to MacOS we know today. After a decade Apple was near bankruptcy, tons of CEOs and employees came and left Apple. In 1997 Gil Amelio, former CEO of Apple at that time bought NeXT company with all its employees, Jobs was then appointed as a Pioneer CEO to handle the situation of Apple.<br>Jobs then in 1999 released the first iMac G3. iMac G3 which was originally known as iMac back then. Apple then had transited from Motorola processors to PowerPC which were more efficient back then. The iMac had a more advanced PowerPC G3 processor. The iMac was dramatically different from any previous mainstream computer. It was made of translucent "Bondi Blue"-colored plastic, and was egg-shaped around a 15-inch (38.1 cm) CRT display. The case included a handle, and the peripheral connectors were hidden behind a door on the right-hand side of the machine. Dual headphone jacks in the front complemented the built-in stereo speakers. Danny Coster was the original designer of the product, and Jonathan Ive helped further the process. The iMac G3's unique shape and color options helped ingrain itself into late 1990s pop culture. The iMac was the first computer to exclusively offer USB ports as standard, including as the connector for its new keyboard and mouse, thus abandoning previous Macintosh peripheral connections, such as the ADB, SCSI and GeoPort serial ports.<br>Then next launch of Apple revolutionized the music industry. It was a small portable MP3 player known as – iPod. It could really store a thousand songs in your pocket and play it all in just one click.<br>Then next was the MacBook. MacBook was a portable computer which looked like the PowerBook G4. Apple had transitioned then from PowerPC to Intel. The MacBook then could have 4 – 8 gigs of RAM an Intel duo processor and also cold get connected to internet wirelessly with AirPort support.<br>Then came the world’s first phone to be called truly smart – the iPhone. Apple unleashed the iPhone in 2007. Then was the iPad which was also known as a bigger iPod touch. Then there was Airpods, Apple TV, Apple Watch.

          <p style="text-align :center">Ethical codes of conduct are the basis of a company cannot exist without it as there would be no direction, motivation or discipline.<br>Here at Apple, the ethical codes are based on internationally recognised human rights, as set out in the United Nations’ International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Apple is deeply committed to respecting the highest standards of labour, human rights, environmental, and ethical conduct. Apple’s suppliers are required to provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect, act fairly and ethically and use environmentally responsible practices wherever they make products or perform services to for Apple Supplier Code of Conduct.<br>Apple is also committed to respecting their workers and human rights
            We at Apple believe that all workers in out supply chain deserve a fair and ethical workplace. Workers must be treated with utmost dignity and respect, and Apple suppliers shall uphold the highest standards of human rights which includes -
            Anti-Discrimination, Anti-Harassment and Abuse, Prevention of Involuntary Labour, Thirst-Party Employment Agencies, etc

          <!--<a href="#header">History of Apple</a>-->
          <p style="text-align :center">Apple commits to be 100 percent carbon neutral for its supply chain and products by 2030.<br>Apple plans to bring its entire carbon footprint to net zero 2 decades sooner than Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) targets. Apple is providing detail on its approach to carbon neutrality with a roadmap for other companies, as industries look to reduce their impact on climate change. In its 2020 Environmental Progress Report — released today — Apple details its plans to reduce emissions by 75 percent by 2030 while developing innovative carbon removal solutions for the remaining 25 percent of its comprehensive footprint.<br>Low carbon product design: Apple’s 10-year roadmap will lower emissions with series of innovative actions, including: Apple will continue to increase the use of low carbon and recycled materials in its products, innovate in product recycling, and design products to be as energy efficient as possible.
            Here at Apple we had also designed a robot called “Dave” which disassembled the Taptic Engine from iPhone to better recover key materials such as rare earth magnates and tungsten while also enabling recovery of steel of iPhones with help of a robot called “Daisy”.All iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch devices released in the past year are made with recycled content, including 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in the iPhone Taptic Engine — a first for Apple and for any smartphone.<br>Apple decreased its carbon footprint by 4.3 million metric tons in 2019 through design and recycled content innovations in its products. Over the past 11 years, Apple has reduced the average energy needed for product use by 73 percent.<br>Renewable energy: Apple will remain at 100 percent renewable energy for its operations — focusing on creating new projects and moving its entire supply chain to clean power.Process and material innovations: Apple will tackle emissions through technological improvements to processes and materials needed for its products.

            It has to be noted that “Steve Jobs wasn’t known for philanthropy. Some wondered if he made anonymous donations to charity, some criticized him for his lack of public giving, while others defended him”.
            However, with Tim Cook assuming Apple leadership in 2011, the focus on CSR aspect of the business has increased to a considerable extent.
